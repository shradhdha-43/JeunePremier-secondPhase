        "desc": "Worldwide, grey school gates are turning into red carpets.  True thrillers unfold themselves, in which children play the leading roles and parents try to steer everything in the right direction in the role of director. Contradictions were never so apparent and emotions never dissipated so quickly. As the night irrevocably gives birth to the morning, at the school gate every tear dries up and transforms into a pure smile. The cinematic event on 1 September serves as the main source of inspiration for Jeune Premier.  It is her mission to give every child the attention it deserves; to allow them to play the main character in their own film. \nActing has never been so easy.",
